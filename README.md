# odd-or-even
I was bored and was thinking of a weird idea, how can a program tell if an interger is even or odd without looking at any bits while treating the inputed values as numbers and not strings. I do realize that if I left the conversion as a string then I could use the last digit *symbol* to tell if the number was even or not but that would ruin the fun.

This small program answered my question and kept me busy for a small time as I figured out the algrothim I would use to solve this.

I understand that this program is useless, its suppose to because I wanted to challenge myself seeing if I could solve a common solution with more limitation than normal.
