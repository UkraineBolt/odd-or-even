# odd-or-even
I was bored and was thinking of a weird idea, how can a program tell if an interger is even or odd without looking at any bits.
This small program answered my question and kept me busy for a small time as I figured out the algrothim I would use to solve this.

I understand that this program is useless, its suppose to because I wanted to challenge myself seeing if I could solve a common solution with more limitation than normal.
